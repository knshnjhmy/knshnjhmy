- âš¡ Fun fact:The term "bug" to describe a problem in a program actually originates from an incident involving a moth. In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist,
-    found a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer.
-    She famously removed the moth and taped it into the logbook, noting "First actual case of bug being found." This incident popularized the term "bug" to describe a flaw or error in a computer program.
